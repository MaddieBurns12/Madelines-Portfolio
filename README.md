Description: 

Given a mock up of the desktop version and mobile version of an example portfolio website, I designed and put together my own portfolio website. This was accomplished by:
      
      1. Building an HTML.
      
      2. Designing HTML elements through a CSS style sheet. 
      
      3. Checking and editing my work through Chrome DevTools before adding them to my code.
      
      4. Using MediaQueries to make the website mobile-friendly.
