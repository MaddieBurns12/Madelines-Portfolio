                My name is Madeline Johanna Burns, I'm 23 years old, and I am from Apex, North Carolina. My whole family besides myself is from Maryland, but they all moved here right before I was born. I think this gives me a distinct advantage of being "from the South", but having a strong appreciation for blue crabs. 
            </br></br>Growing up, my favorite (well, only) sport I played was horseback riding. Yes, I'm a horse girl. I began riding when I was six and have been ever since! My horse's name is Max, and he's getting pretty old now and I am rather busy so I don't ride as much as I used to. 
            </br></br>I got my Associates in Science from Wake Tech a couple months ago. I really didn't want to have to do more traditional schooling and get my Bachelor's, but, the way I saw it, I didn't have much of a choice. I was applying to schools when my brother introduced the idea of coding to me - him being a back-end web developer himself - and the rest is history!
